## Resources

This is a load of small guides and cheat sheet style snippets that help me in my work.  
Occasionally they may not be the best way to do things but just the way that I've found to work in the time I've had available. If you have any suggestions for better ways to do things please get in touch or put in a pull request directly in github.  
  
  
### Development
[Docker](https://grdwyer.github.io/resources/docker) - I use docker for almost all of my development, makes life easier for switching between different projects with different dependencies (like different ROS distributions).


### System
[Linux Kernels](https://grdwyer.github.io/resources/linux-kernels) - For systems controlling hardware, I normally change the kernel, these are configured to be faster but at the expense of power saving features.  
  
[Network configuration](https://grdwyer.github.io/resources/netplan) - Netplan is now the default network manager for ubuntu, this has a brief guide for setting it up.  
  
[Process priorities](https://grdwyer.github.io/resources/process-priorities) - how to adjust the priority of processes  
  
[Setting up a raspberry pi](https://grdwyer.github.io/resources/raspberry-pi-setup) - mainly how to get it running headlessly  
  
[Time synchronisation](https://grdwyer.github.io/resources/time-synchronisation) - how to get multiple systems on the same clock, useful for ROS things where timestamped messages go between systems
