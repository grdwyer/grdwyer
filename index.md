## George Dwyer

**This website is very much a work in progress**  
The idea is to have a small portfolio of projects that I've worked on, bits of code and ways to set things up that could possibly be useful to other people.   

### About me
I'm a research fellow in Computer Science at UCL currently working on robot assisted fabrication in the operating room. I'm funded by a UCL EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellowship.  

### Research
 - Robot Assisted Fabrication in the Operating Room
 - Micro-resector 
 - Robotic Actuation for Fetoscopic Interventions (my PhD work)

### Resources
I try to document things that took me a while to figure out or that I have to everyonce in a while but can't remember the exact commands. [This](https://grdwyer.github.io/resources) has a list of all the ones I've written up so far.
