**This website is very much a work in progress**  
The idea is to have a small portfolio of projects that I've worked on, bits of code and ways to set things up that could possibly be useful to other people.   

### About me
I'm a research fellow in Computer Science at UCL currently working on robot assisted fabrication in the operating room. I'm funded by a UCL EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellowship.
